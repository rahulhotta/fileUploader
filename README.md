# File Uploader Web Application

A React + TypeScript + vite application that allows users to upload multiple files with real-time progress tracking, cancel uploads, reset all uploads, and view success/error notifications using toast messages.

The app uses a mock upload API (`https://httpbin.org/post`) and is designed with a clean, component-based architecture.
